Portfolio Optimization with OLS & Neural Networks (ESG + SMFIV)

Overview
This repository contains the code and experimental pipeline for my Master’s thesis:
“OLS and Neural Network Approaches to Portfolio Optimization Integrating SMFIV and ESG Scores with STOXX Europe 600 Constituents (August 2016 – June 2024)”
The project studies how to combine:
Traditional econometric models (Panel OLS)
Neural Networks (Feedforward NN)
with
ESG scores (Bloomberg ESG)
Option-implied volatility signals (SMFIV, model-free implied variance)
to construct and evaluate portfolio optimization strategies under different market regimes.

The main goal is to compare linear vs. nonlinear models in capturing the joint effects of:
Slow-moving fundamental ESG signals
Fast-moving market-implied volatility signals
on portfolio risk-adjusted performance.

Key Research Questions
1. ESG Factor Significance
Do ESG scores explain cross-sectional stock returns in the STOXX Europe 600 universe?
2. Incremental Value of SMFIV
Does adding option-implied volatility (SMFIV) improve portfolio Sharpe ratio and drawdown control?
3. OLS vs. Neural Networks
Do neural networks outperform traditional OLS in capturing nonlinear relationships, especially across different market regimes?

Methodology
Data Universe
Equity universe: STOXX Europe 600 constituents (Aug 2016 – Jun 2024)
ESG: Bloomberg ESG scores (used as ESG factor inputs)
Options: Index-level option-implied volatility to construct SMFIV
Target: Monthly stock returns

Models
Panel OLS (benchmark linear model)
Feedforward Neural Network (nonlinear model for return prediction)

Portfolio Construction
Forecast-driven portfolio weights
Optimization objective: Sharpe ratio
Evaluation metrics:
Annualized return
Volatility
Sharpe ratio
Maximum drawdown

Main Findings (Summary)
First, ESG scores alone demonstrated limited and inconsistent predictive power for stock
returns.
Second, option-implied volatility signals, represented by SMFIV, offered additional
information content when combined with ESG factors.
Third, the modelling advantage of neural networks was conditional rather than universal.
Fourth, Panel D synthesises the cumulative investment implications of different model
and factor combinations.
